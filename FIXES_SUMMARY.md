# Cycle Time Monitoring - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Process 2 LINEOUT - Timer Still Running
**Problem**: When LINEOUT was submitted in Process 2, the timer continued running in the background.

**Solution**: Added timer stop logic in the `submitLineout()` function before submitting the lineout:
```javascript
// FIX: Stop timer before submitting lineout
if (timerInterval !== null) {
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
    timerInterval = null;
    updateStatus("STATUS: STOPPED", "stopped");
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- templates/process2.html
- templates/process3.html
- templates/process4.html

### 2. Process 3-4 No SQL Update on STOP and LINEOUT
**Problem**: Database updates were failing for Process 3 and 4 when STOP or LINEOUT was pressed.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `sendDataToDatabase()` function with:
- Retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- Better error handling with user notifications
- HTTP status code checking
- Detailed error logging

**Files Modified**:
- templates/process2.html
- templates/process3.html
- templates/process4.html

### 3. SHARED_DROPDOWN_ITEMS Removed from localStorage
**Problem**: Custom dropdown items added by users were not persisting across sessions.

**Solution**: Implemented persistent storage for dropdown items:
- Added `SHARED_DROPDOWN_ITEMS_KEY` constant
- Created `saveDropdownItems()` function to save all dropdown options to localStorage
- Created `loadDropdownItems()` function to restore saved options on page load
- Modified `addDropdownItem()` to save after adding new items
- Added save/load calls in window event listeners

**Files Modified**:
- templates/process2.html
- templates/process3.html
- templates/process4.html

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added retry mechanism for failed database requests
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

### Timer Management
- Ensured timer is properly stopped before any LINEOUT operation
- Consistent status updates across all processes

### Data Persistence
- Dropdown items now persist across browser sessions
- Shared across all process pages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Timer Stop Test**:
   - Start timer in any process
   - Click LINEOUT
   - Verify timer stops and resets to 00:00

2. **Database Update Test**:
   - Test STOP button in Process 3 and 4
   - Check database for record insertion
   - Test LINEOUT with reasons

3. **Dropdown Persistence Test**:
   - Add custom dropdown item in any process
   - Navigate to another process
   - Verify custom item appears in dropdown
   - Close browser and reopen
   - Verify items still persist

## Notes

- All fixes maintain backward compatibility
- No database schema changes required
- Fixes are applied at the frontend level
- localStorage is used for dropdown persistence (client-side only)
