# Latest Fixes Summary - December 3, 2026

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Remove SHARED_DROPDOWN_ITEMS from localStorage at Application Tab
**Problem**: Dropdown items were persisting in localStorage, causing unwanted data retention.

**Solution**: 
- Added localStorage.removeItem() calls for both 'SHARED_DROPDOWN_ITEMS' and 'shared_dropdown_items' 
- Disabled the saveDropdownItems() and loadDropdownItems() functions by commenting them out
- Modified addDropdownItem() to only add items for the current session (no persistence)

**Files Modified**:
- templates/process2.html
- templates/process3.html
- templates/process4.html

### 2. Display Next Kitting Number After LINEOUT
**Problem**: When LINEOUT was submitted, the confirmation message didn't show the next kitting number to be processed.

**Solution**: 
- Modified alert messages in submitLineout() to include: "Next kitting number to process: {statusCount + 1}"
- Also updated showOthersInput() function to display the next kitting number
- This applies to all processes (2, 3, and 4)

**Example Output**:
```
Lineout submitted successfully!
Reason: LEAK
Counter: 5

Process 3 cannot run counter 5

Next kitting number to process: 6
```

## Code Changes

### localStorage Cleanup
```javascript
// Remove SHARED_DROPDOWN_ITEMS from localStorage
localStorage.removeItem('SHARED_DROPDOWN_ITEMS');
localStorage.removeItem('shared_dropdown_items');
```

### Next Kitting Number Display
```javascript
// Show confirmation with NEXT kitting number
alert(`Lineout submitted successfully!\nReason: ${reason}\nCounter: ${counterToBlock}\n\nProcess ${processNumber + 1} cannot run counter ${counterToBlock}\n\nNext kitting number to process: ${statusCount + 1}`);
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test localStorage cleanup**:
   - Open any process page
   - Check Application tab in browser dev tools
   - Verify SHARED_DROPDOWN_ITEMS and shared_dropdown_items are removed
   - Add custom dropdown item
   - Refresh page - verify item is not loaded (session-only)

2. **Test next kitting number display**:
   - Start any process (2, 3, or 4)
   - Click LINEOUT and select a reason
   - Verify the alert shows the next kitting number
   - Test with "Others" option as well

## Notes

- All dropdown items are now session-only (not persisted)
- The next kitting number shown is always statusCount + 1
- Timer is properly stopped before LINEOUT submission (previous fix)
- Database retry logic is still active (previous fix)
